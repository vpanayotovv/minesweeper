# Minesweeper demo project

Technology demo, programming exercise and a tribute to the classic minesweeper game.

## Spring MVC

This implementation is a simple "web 1.0" application. The aim of this application was to
write as clean and understandable code as possible.

As the application is written fully in Java, all moves in the game are processed by the 
back-end and each move in the game reloads the whole page. This is more of a technology 
demo than a polished entertainment product, so please do not expect too much from the user
experience.

### Requirements and installation

This application requires Apache Maven 3 build automation tool and Java SE Development 
Kit 8.

To start the server:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

When the application is running, you can access it with your browser at 
**http://localhost:8080**.
